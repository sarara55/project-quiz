	  				<p class="one">Adjectives: -ed or -ing? English contains numerous -ed or -ing adjective pairs derived from verbs. To avoid mixing these up, remember that the -ed adjectives are used to describe how you feel, and the -ing adjectives are used for what it is that makes you feel that way. Here are some examples:</p>
					<p class="two">	&#8226 I feel tired. - Working in the garden all day is very tiring.<br>
						&#8226 I am bored. - This grammar lesson is boring.<br> 
						&#8226 She was disappointed. - Her test score was disappointing.<br>
						&#8226 I'm interested in Biology. - I think Biology is interesting.<br>
						&#8226 He was shocked. - He found your behaviour shocking.<br>
						&#8226 I'm very confused by this film. - This film is very confusing.<br></p>
